## 📚 What is Pinecone MCP Server?

The Pinecone MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that connects AI models to [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a high-performance vector database designed for similarity search. This server enables AI assistants to store, retrieve, and query vector embeddings, facilitating semantic search, recommendations, and knowledge retrieval from unstructured data.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Semantic Search** - Find contextually similar content using vector embeddings
- **Document Processing** - Convert documents into searchable vector representations
- **Knowledge Retrieval** - Access relevant information based on semantic similarity
- **Vector Management** - Store and organize vector embeddings efficiently
- **Integration with LLMs** - Enhance AI capabilities with relevant context

---

## 🛠️ Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **semantic-search** | Search for semantically similar content in the vector database |
| **read-document** | Retrieve specific documents from the Pinecone index |
| **list-documents** | View available documents in the Pinecone database |
| **pinecone-stats** | Get statistics about your Pinecone index usage and performance |
| **process-document** | Convert and index new documents into searchable vectors |
