## ⚙️ Server Configuration

The Abstract API MCP Server requires your API key to be set in the environment. You can configure this in two ways:

### Option 1: Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the abstract-api-mcp-server with the following content:

```
ABSTRACT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Option 2: Direct Configuration

You can also set the API key directly in the server configuration:

1. Open `c:\Users\siddi\OneDrive\Desktop\final\adya_mcp_hackathon-main\mcp_servers\python\servers\abstractapi-mcp-server\server.py`
2. Locate the line with `ABSTRACT_API_KEY = os.getenv("ABSTRACT_API_KEY", "your_api_key_here")`
3. Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key

## 🔍 Verifying Credentials

To verify your API key is working correctly:

1. Start the Abstract API MCP Server
2. Try running a simple email validation test
3. Check that you receive a proper response without authentication errors
