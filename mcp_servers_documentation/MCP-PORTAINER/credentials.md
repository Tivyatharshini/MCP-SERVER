## How to Obtain Credentials

2. **Username & Password**: Use the credentials you created when setting up your Portainer instance
   - If you're using an organization's Portainer, contact your system administrator for API access
   - Ensure your user account has sufficient permissions to manage containers

3. **Security Notes**:
   - Store credentials securely using environment variables
   - Avoid hardcoding credentials in your application
   - Consider using API tokens instead of username/password for production environments
